        blurb: The debut album from S. Carey, All We Grow, is the result of a young lifetime immersed in music.  As a band member of Bon Iver, Sean Carey witnessed a flip of his formal training to step firmly into a worldwide-touring rock band. His performance degree in classical percussion and his love for jazz drumming prepared him for a central role in the inspiring force of the Bon Iver live show.

            -   title: Glass/Film
                lyrics:
                    - Counting the hours, come where I lay
                    - Slipped through a little hole in the film
                    - Silent hills, patchwork fields, fall bitter lines
                    - Oh my darling dear
                    - <br>
                    - Sleep to see what it looks like
                    - I never meant to do no harm
                    - In the glass, see your face,
                    - I know this place, I called the case
                    - I was made for this
                    - I was tamed by this
            -   title: Creaking
                lyrics:
                    - Oh the lightning falls on dad’s house
                    - We were swimming when the monsoons hit
                    - Creaking
                    - Creaking
                    - There are things here I could not see before
                    - All my memories found between the boards
                    - Creaking
                    - Creaking
            -   title: Crown the Pines
                lyrics:
                    - I am in love with this place
                    - But I fear for its grace
                    - Shoot the sky
                    - Opens up like the sea
                    - And the resinous high
                    - Bloodlines and divines
                    - Will my kids see the trees?
                    - Will the glen fall on me?
                    - <br>
                    - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
                    - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
                    - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
                    - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
                    - <br>
                    - Crown the pines
                    - I worship the sound
                    - Mother cliffs
                    - Adorn it, the ground
                    - Spread the sand, my father’s land
                    - <br>
                    - (Dedicated to Dad and Dubs)
            -   title: Fire-Scene
                lyrics:
                    - The city’s fire
                    - Trapped behind the earth
                    - Digging in your deepest dirt
                    - <br>
                    - The reddest hue
                    - Reminds you of you
                    - Clinging love and falling true
                    - <br>
                    - On and On
                    - All I want is honesty
                    - <br>
                    - Tree has snapped
                    - Sparks are flying everywhere
                    - Cables burnt and lines flare
                    - <br>
                    - And when the all in all
                    - Comes falling down
                    - It was just an accident
                    - Something you can’t help
                    - <br>
                    - On and On
                    - All I want is honesty
            -   title: Radiant
                lyrics:
                    - You were radiant
                    - And I’m ready
                    - For to bring a flower in
                    - <br>
                    - The sun was up
                    - And the frost was gone
                    - And in that dew-drop dress a fawn

                    - And the spots were on
                    - But I’m calm this run
                    - Emerging one sun-swept dawn
                    - <br>
                    - There’s a rise ahead
                    - And I’m ready
                    - For to bring a flower on the bed
            -   title: Alpenglow
                lyrics:
                    - I’ve been waiting on the proper time
                    - I was hoping that you’d take my line
                    - Make it pure and make it still
                    - You will, you will, you will
                    - All mine
                    - <br>
                    - You were saying when you know you know
                    - We were walking in the year’s first snow
                    - Hushed white in Alpenglow
                    - We lay, we lay, we lay
                    - All day
                    - <br>
                    - I was wondering if you’d be my wife
                    - Be the compass in my rugged life
                    - Calm this quaking leaf until
                    - You will, you will, you will
                    - All mine
                    - <br>
                    - I was hoping you would walk with me
                    - Down the Aisles of Light gallery
                    - Leave a child with legacy
                    - We lay, we lay, we lay
                    - All day
                    - <br>
                    - And when she came
                    - I grabbed her head
                    - And dipped her in the lake
                    - And seldom seen, a side of me
                    - Beneath my feet the earthen shake
                    - I can’t calm down
                    - I’m flooding in spring
                    - And swelling from the sound
                    - And I am driftwood found
            -   title: Fleeting Light
                lyrics:
                    - Golden hills
                    - You live below
                    - That bridge is everlasting
                    - Bold and bright
                    - You blazed the night
                    - That trail is never fading
                    - Not without the fleeting light
                    - <br>
                    - Range of Light
                    - Adorned in white
                    - In fields, first dawn is yawning
                    - Not without that fleeting light
                    - <br>
                    - The future
                    - Unfolding
                    - The fall light
                    - Instilling
                    - Hot granite
                    - Climbed Half Dome
                    - The tan lines
                    - In sun-chrome
                    - And westward
                    - Found tea pool
                    - And beach walks
                    - With Tiny
                    - The steeple
                    - The belfry
                    - Surpassing
                    - The old scenes
                    - Come chanting
                    - The chorus
                    - And cliff side
                    - We’ll shore up
                    - Small winged
                    - The big trees
                    - Wawona
                    - You miss me
                    - The future
                    - Unfolding
                    - The fall light
                    - Instilling
                    - Hot granite
                    - Climbed Half Dome
                    - The tan lines
                    - In sun-chrome
                    - <br>
                    - (Dedicated to Shannon and Gabe)
            -   title: The Dome
                lyrics:
                    - Root the road, my feet are sure
                    - Come, I know where we can go
                    - Calm the move, the mystery
                    - Terraced red, found-sound history
                    - Stay, I will be gone be for days
                    - Ocean blue and elbow-waves
                    - Steep, unfold, unbending path
                    - Trust my gut, the beauty-bath
                    - Still, I fall too close
                    - Be where I say, “I’m yours”
                    - The back and forth
                    - All unknown is where I’m going
            -   title: Neverending Fountain
                lyrics:
                    - I know my heart better than you may think
                    - It swells but keeps on the bank of a May creek
                    - And when we see it All
                    - And the exit sign
                    - <br>
                    - We build our scrape past the moors on Cliff-Keep
                    - "The bottom line:  out of stone I will seep"
                    - "We look up:  Neverending Fountain"
                    - My wings are pure and forever sounding
                    - "The sky, my hub, and harken:  crowning"
                    - Where basins boom and my heart is bounding
                    - <br>
                    - And when we see it All
                    - And the exit sign
                    - Where cool creeks collide
                    - Of the true and the tried
                    - I will be home, hawk-eyed
                    - <br>
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient
