        blurb: The Wilder creates strange and lovely bedfellows of sound - banjos, vibes, pedal steel, and ambient vocals make up this once bluegrass-picking songwriter's newly roused approach to making music. The end result is somewhere between the likes of Iron & Wine and Emmylou Harris. Inspired by her travels, Luray is named after the Virginia town at the foothills of the Shenandoah Mountains. I am a wanderer and a traveler by nature. I resonate with certain places and become quicly attached. Luray was like that,” Shannon explains. “It's tall grass, wildflowers, and rolling green hills hit me at a time when I was experiencing a lot of change and loss. I discovered these songs were within me, and was coaxing them into form. The lush life in the Shenandoah Valley in early spring helped convince me that the songs were worth writing.”
