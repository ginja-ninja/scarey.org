        blurb: Recorded primarily during the perigee-syzygy (also known as the super moon) of August 2014, the <span class='italic'>Supermoon EP</span> from S. Carey is a study in scale, space, and proximity. These songs are a new and closer look into existing works from both S. Carey's renowned full-lengths, 2010's <span class='italic'>All We Grow</span> and 2014's <span class='italic'>Range of Light</span>. With <span class='italic'>Supermoon</span>, Carey has broken these songs down to their essential, acoustic parts with his forever humming vocals laid over top, lilting yet percussive piano, and a subtle swath of harmonic strings. You can hear Carey's breath between words and the pat of his fingers on the keys; you can hear the living room in which his family's baby grand piano sits. These songs are beautiful, intimate and so potently personal. This collection is a stark presentation of S. Carey laid bare, an open invitation for the listener to climb into his world

            -   title: Fire-scene (alt. version)
                lyrics:
                    - The city’s fire
                    - Trapped behind the earth
                    - Digging in your deepest dirt
                    - <br>
                    - The reddest hue
                    - Reminds you of you
                    - Clinging love and falling true
                    - <br>
                    - On and On
                    - All I want is honesty
                    - <br>
                    - Tree has snapped
                    - Sparks are flying everywhere
                    - Cables burnt and lines flare
                    - <br>
                    - And when the all in all
                    - Comes falling down
                    - It was just an accident
                    - Something you can’t help
                    - <br>
                    - On and On
                    - All I want is honesty
            -   title: We Fell (alt. version)
                lyrics:
                    - The consonance of drone
                    - And love sounds its own
                    - Your arms wrapped around home
                    - All the in-betweens
                    - Lay so blue beside me
                    - We fell
                    - More than skin and bones
                    - No we're not alone
                    - We fell
                    - Like stones
                    - Between
            -   title: Supermoon
            -   title: In The Stream (alt. version)
                lyrics:
                    - I was folded by ferns
                    - You could return, the earth
                    - All to her
                    - Open mouth
                    - Look up and out
                    - Fall my failures
                    - To the ground
                    - I know
                    - I know
                    - I know
                    - All them
                    - I am wind in the pines
                    - I am a line
                    - You can't define
                    - When the dawn breaks
                    - In my love-lock landscapes
                    - I know
                    - I know
                    - I know
                    - All them
                    - Be in my vision
                    - My gardener
                    - I'll be an architect
                    - On window steam
                    - I'll be in the stream
                    - Be in that canyon
                    - That corridor
                    - I'll be an architect
                    - On window steam
                    - I'll be in the stream
            -   title: Neverending Fountain (alt. version)
                lyrics:
                    - I know my heart better than you may think
                    - It swells but keeps on the bank of a May creek
                    - And when we see it All
                    - And the exit sign
                    - <br>
                    - We build our scrape past the moors on Cliff-Keep
                    - "The bottom line:  out of stone I will seep"
                    - "We look up:  Neverending Fountain"
                    - My wings are pure and forever sounding
                    - "The sky, my hub, and harken:  crowning"
                    - Where basins boom and my heart is bounding
                    - <br>
                    - And when we see it All
                    - And the exit sign
                    - Where cool creeks collide
                    - Of the true and the tried
                    - I will be home, hawk-eyed
                    - <br>
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient
                    - Searching, patient

        blurb: <span class="italic">Hoyas</span> by S. Carey is a hospitable statement about love, longing and the celebration of knowing it well. You will find the familiar S. Carey modern classical repetition pushed into the vernacular of electronic music and beat making. This is the warmest electronic music you'll ever meet. The beats swing, stutter and pulse while each instrument retains a heightened awareness of its form and function within the larger family of voices.

            -   title: Two Angles
                lyrics:
                    - I spy two lovers
                    - Underneath a portico
                    - They cling in November cold
                    - They never were this bold and sterling
                    - In the fog-lift
                    - <br>
                    - The swaying symmetry
                    - Retreat to the falls
                    - Cascading of everything
                    - All to my toes
                    - The beauty of two angles
                    - And then my life untangled
                    - <br>
                    - I swear, I swear, I swear
                    - <br>
                    - In the cloud-hang
                    - To a grass-blade
                    - To the earth’s tomb
                    - My love is real
            -   title: Avalanche
                lyrics:
                    - No one came to take you there
                    - All the streams on Oberon
                    - Everything you called to her
                    - In your heart I know there’re words
                    - These are not the ones in it
                    - Everything you say you’ll do
                    - I was in the corner room
                    - We cannot to begin to lose
                    - All it was and ever said
                    - <br>
                    - Don’t be there against my will
                    - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
                    - Don‘t be there for no one
                    - <br>
                    - Baby in the corner room
                    - All that I could say to you is nearly ordinary
                    - A map beneath window the sill
                    - All that you could ever kill
                    - All it was on Ever-seas
                    - I need something new
                    - I need solace
                    - <br>
                    - Don’t be there against my will
                    - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
                    - Don’t be there for no one
                    - All the time

                lyrics:
                    - They won’t tell you
                    - About the love and honor
                    - They won’t find
                    - I know stories
                    - About reeling and falling
                    - <br>
                    - In that gentle grass
                    - <br>

                    - About reeling and falling
                    - I know the answers
                    - Reeling and Falling
                    - <br>
                    - Use the forest
                    - Midnight gentle grass
                    - In that gentle grass
