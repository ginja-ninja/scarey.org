        blurb: <span class="italic">Hoyas</span> by S. Carey is a hospitable statement about love, longing and the celebration of knowing it well. You will find the familiar S. Carey modern classical repetition pushed into the vernacular of electronic music and beat making. This is the warmest electronic music you'll ever meet. The beats swing, stutter and pulse while each instrument retains a heightened awareness of its form and function within the larger family of voices.

            -   title: Two Angles
                lyrics:
                    - I spy two lovers
                    - Underneath a portico
                    - They cling in November cold
                    - They never were this bold and sterling
                    - In the fog-lift
                    - <br>
                    - The swaying symmetry
                    - Retreat to the falls
                    - Cascading of everything
                    - All to my toes
                    - The beauty of two angles
                    - And then my life untangled
                    - <br>
                    - I swear, I swear, I swear
                    - <br>
                    - In the cloud-hang
                    - To a grass-blade
                    - To the earth’s tomb
                    - My love is real
            -   title: Avalanche
                lyrics:
                    - No one came to take you there
                    - All the streams on Oberon
                    - Everything you called to her
                    - In your heart I know there’re words
                    - These are not the ones in it
                    - Everything you say you’ll do
                    - I was in the corner room
                    - We cannot to begin to lose
                    - All it was and ever said
                    - <br>
                    - Don’t be there against my will
                    - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
                    - Don‘t be there for no one
                    - <br>
                    - Baby in the corner room
                    - All that I could say to you is nearly ordinary
                    - A map beneath window the sill
                    - All that you could ever kill
                    - All it was on Ever-seas
                    - I need something new
                    - I need solace
                    - <br>
                    - Don’t be there against my will
                    - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
                    - Don’t be there for no one
                    - All the time

            -   title: Marfa
                lyrics:
                    - They won’t tell you
                    - About the love and honor
                    - They won’t find
                    - I know stories
                    - About reeling and falling
                    - <br>
                    - In that gentle grass
                    - <br>
                    - They say stories
                    - About reeling and falling
                    - I know the answers
                    - Reeling and Falling
                    - <br>
                    - Use the forest
                    - Midnight gentle grass
                    - In that gentle grass
