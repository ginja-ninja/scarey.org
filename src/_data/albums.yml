  blurb:
    - At its heart, <em>Hundred Acres</em> - the third full-length from Wisconsin singer/songwriter S. Carey - finds him grounded and confident, writing the strongest songs of his career. More direct than ever, there is a wellspring of confidence in this new batch of songs that allow for ideas to remain uncomplicated while laying bare the intricacies of life.
    - Written in between touring schedules and the growth of his family, Carey produced <em>Hundred Acres</em> at April Base in Fall Creek, WI with support from his regular crew and contributions from the likes of Rob Moose (yMusic), Casey Foubert (Sufjan Stevens) and Sophie Payten (Gordi). He employed a smaller, more focused scale of instrumentation than on his previous albums while writing mostly on guitar instead of his go-to piano. Using more traditional song structures instead of the Steve Reich-ian repetitions of his past work, a new balance is struck that creates something unique. The result is a collection of poetic yet clear-eyed songs that both stand brightly on their own and tightly weave together to create a powerful album.

  blurb:
    - <em>Range of Light</em> incorporates elements of his previous work, but also amplifies Carey’s percussive proclivities, and is altogether more developed than its predecessors, with more input on the performance and even composition side from the band of musicians and best friends he assembled originally to bring <em>All We Grow</em> to life in the live setting. “There were times during recording sessions when there were three percussionists, all with different styles and fortes, playing at once, adding different textures."
    - From the flurry of violins over a circular rhythm in ‘Crown The Pines’ and the beautiful cries of ‘Alpenglow’, to the pensive depths of songs like ‘Fire-scene’ and ‘The Dome’, <em>Range of Light</em> is a still life of an artist in this particular stage of his life; a stage that has been met with the highest of peaks and the lowest of depths all within the range each of us treads through.

    - title: Glass/Film
      lyrics:
        - Counting the hours, come where I lay
        - Slipped through a little hole in the film
        - Silent hills, patchwork fields, fall bitter lines
        - Oh my darling dear
        - <br>
        - Sleep to see what it looks like
        - I never meant to do no harm
        - In the glass, see your face,
        - I know this place, I called the case
        - I was made for this
        - I was tamed by this
    - title: Creaking
      lyrics:
        - Oh the lightning falls on dad’s house
        - We were swimming when the monsoons hit
        - Creaking
        - Creaking
        - There are things here I could not see before
        - All my memories found between the boards
        - Creaking
        - Creaking
    - title: Crown the Pines
      lyrics:
        - I am in love with this place
        - But I fear for its grace
        - Shoot the sky
        - Opens up like the sea
        - And the resinous high
        - Bloodlines and divines
        - Will my kids see the trees?
        - Will the glen fall on me?
        - <br>
        - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
        - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
        - Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
        - Where I learned to be a light at dusk
        - <br>
        - Crown the pines
        - I worship the sound
        - Mother cliffs
        - Adorn it, the ground
        - Spread the sand, my father’s land
        - <br>
        - (Dedicated to Dad and Dubs)
    - title: Fire-Scene
      lyrics:
        - The city’s fire
        - Trapped behind the earth
        - Digging in your deepest dirt
        - <br>
        - The reddest hue
        - Reminds you of you
        - Clinging love and falling true
        - <br>
        - On and On
        - All I want is honesty
        - <br>
        - Tree has snapped
        - Sparks are flying everywhere
        - Cables burnt and lines flare
        - <br>
        - And when the all in all
        - Comes falling down
        - It was just an accident
        - Something you can’t help
        - <br>
        - On and On
        - All I want is honesty
    - title: Radiant
      lyrics:
        - You were radiant
        - And I’m ready
        - For to bring a flower in
        - <br>
        - The sun was up
        - And the frost was gone
        - And in that dew-drop dress a fawn
        - And the spots were on
        - But I’m calm this run
        - Emerging one sun-swept dawn
        - <br>
        - There’s a rise ahead
        - And I’m ready
        - For to bring a flower on the bed
    - title: Alpenglow
      lyrics:
        - I’ve been waiting on the proper time
        - I was hoping that you’d take my line
        - Make it pure and make it still
        - You will, you will, you will
        - All mine
        - <br>
        - You were saying when you know you know
        - We were walking in the year’s first snow
        - Hushed white in Alpenglow
        - We lay, we lay, we lay
        - All day
        - <br>
        - I was wondering if you’d be my wife
        - Be the compass in my rugged life
        - Calm this quaking leaf until
        - You will, you will, you will
        - All mine
        - <br>
        - I was hoping you would walk with me
        - Down the Aisles of Light gallery
        - Leave a child with legacy
        - We lay, we lay, we lay
        - All day
        - <br>
        - And when she came
        - I grabbed her head
        - And dipped her in the lake
        - And seldom seen, a side of me
        - Beneath my feet the earthen shake
        - I can’t calm down
        - I’m flooding in spring
        - And swelling from the sound
        - And I am driftwood found
    - title: Fleeting Light
      lyrics:
        - Golden hills
        - You live below
        - That bridge is everlasting
        - Bold and bright
        - You blazed the night
        - That trail is never fading
        - Not without the fleeting light
        - <br>
        - Range of Light
        - Adorned in white
        - In fields, first dawn is yawning
        - Not without that fleeting light
        - <br>
        - The future
        - Unfolding
        - The fall light
        - Instilling
        - Hot granite
        - Climbed Half Dome
        - The tan lines
        - In sun-chrome
        - And westward
        - Found tea pool
        - And beach walks
        - With Tiny
        - The steeple
        - The belfry
        - Surpassing
        - The old scenes
        - Come chanting
        - The chorus
        - And cliff side
        - We’ll shore up
        - Small winged
        - The big trees
        - Wawona
        - You miss me
        - The future
        - Unfolding
        - The fall light
        - Instilling
        - Hot granite
        - Climbed Half Dome
        - The tan lines
        - In sun-chrome
        - <br>
        - (Dedicated to Shannon and Gabe)
    - title: The Dome
      lyrics:
        - Root the road, my feet are sure
        - Come, I know where we can go
        - Calm the move, the mystery
        - Terraced red, found-sound history
        - Stay, I will be gone be for days
        - Ocean blue and elbow-waves
        - Steep, unfold, unbending path
        - Trust my gut, the beauty-bath
        - Still, I fall too close
        - Be where I say, “I’m yours”
        - The back and forth
        - All unknown is where I’m going
    - title: Neverending Fountain
      lyrics:
        - I know my heart better than you may think
        - It swells but keeps on the bank of a May creek
        - And when we see it All
        - And the exit sign
        - <br>
        - We build our scrape past the moors on Cliff-Keep
        - "The bottom line:  out of stone I will seep"
        - "We look up:  Neverending Fountain"
        - My wings are pure and forever sounding
        - "The sky, my hub, and harken:  crowning"
        - Where basins boom and my heart is bounding
        - <br>
        - And when we see it All
        - And the exit sign
        - Where cool creeks collide
        - Of the true and the tried
        - I will be home, hawk-eyed
        - <br>
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient

  blurb: The debut album from S. Carey, <em>All We Grow</em>, is the result of a young lifetime immersed in music.  As a band member of Bon Iver, Sean Carey witnessed a flip of his formal training to step firmly into a worldwide-touring rock band. His performance degree in classical percussion and his love for jazz drumming prepared him for a central role in the inspiring force of the Bon Iver live show.

    - title: Move
      lyrics:
        - Dream of a vacant pier
        - Move all your maps to here
        - If I could run my fingers through your hair
        - If you could run along the shore and air
        - I would...
        - Keep all my mornings clear
        - Move all your bees to here
        - If I could run my fingers through your hair
        - If you could run along the shore and air
        - I would...
        - Move
    - title: We Fell
      lyrics:
        - The consonance of drone
        - And love sounds its own
        - Your arms wrapped around home
        - All the in-betweens
        - Lay so blue beside me
        - We fell
        - More than skin and bones
        - No we're not alone
        - We fell
        - Like stones
        - Between
    - title: In The Dirt
      lyrics:
        - Don't leave cause I believe
        - We were meant to sleep
        - In the dirt
        - <br>
        - If you doubt that I'll be there
        - Don't despair
        - Don't you dare
        - <br>
        - Don't leave cause I believe
        - We were meant to sleep
        - In the dirt
    - title: Rothko Fields
    - title: Mothers
      lyrics:
          - Their feet are cracked
          - As they break their back
          - In the sun-heat
          - It's all, yes, it's all
          - For your pennies
          - Their kids can't go to school
          - In the morning
          - Because narcotics grow better than books
          - <br>
          - And my only hope
          - Is for their mothers and their daughters
          - To be loved
          - <br>
          - Only New York can make it right
          - If they want to
          - The consensus is rather apathy
          - My soul, my soul cries for them
          - In the morning
          - Because I'm guilty just the same
          - <br>
          - But eye to eye
          - I haven't been
          - But my cries are swelling
          - Cause they have faces
          - They have faces
          - <br>
          - And my only hope
          - Is for their mothers and their daughters
          - To be loved
    - title: Action
    - title: In The Stream
      lyrics:
        - I was folded by ferns
        - You could return, the earth
        - All to her
        - Open mouth
        - Look up and out
        - Fall my failures
        - To the ground
        - I know
        - I know
        - I know
        - All them
        - I am wind in the pines
        - I am a line
        - You can't define
        - When the dawn breaks
        - In my love-lock landscapes
        - I know
        - I know
        - I know
        - All them
        - Be in my vision
        - My gardener
        - I'll be an architect
        - On window steam
        - I'll be in the stream
        - Be in that canyon
        - That corridor
        - I'll be an architect
        - On window steam
        - I'll be in the stream
    - title: All We Grow
      lyrics:
        - Full year
        - The iris
        - Red wood
        - All we grow
        - I will be honest
        - I tow
        - What I know
    - title: Broken
      lyrics:
        - Stones on weathered shores
        - You were the one
        - I will always be there
        - You wrap your loving arms
        - Around my doubt
        - I am tired of that
        - This won't get broken
        - <br>
        - Home on our front porch
        - All broken down
        - I will always be there
        - Rest your weary head
        - Dismiss your doubt
        - I will always be there
        - This won't get broken

  blurb: Recorded primarily during the perigee-syzygy (also known as the super moon) of August 2014, the <span class='italic'>Supermoon EP</span> from S. Carey is a study in scale, space, and proximity. These songs are a new and closer look into existing works from both S. Carey's renowned full-lengths, 2010's <span class='italic'>All We Grow</span> and 2014's <span class='italic'>Range of Light</span>. With <span class='italic'>Supermoon</span>, Carey has broken these songs down to their essential, acoustic parts with his forever humming vocals laid over top, lilting yet percussive piano, and a subtle swath of harmonic strings. You can hear Carey's breath between words and the pat of his fingers on the keys; you can hear the living room in which his family's baby grand piano sits. These songs are beautiful, intimate and so potently personal. This collection is a stark presentation of S. Carey laid bare, an open invitation for the listener to climb into his world.

        - I know my heart better than you may think
        - It swells but keeps on the bank of a May creek
        - And when we see it All
        - And the exit sign
        - <br>
        - We build our scrape past the moors on Cliff-Keep
        - "The bottom line:  out of stone I will seep"
        - "We look up:  Neverending Fountain"
        - My wings are pure and forever sounding
        - "The sky, my hub, and harken:  crowning"
        - Where basins boom and my heart is bounding
        - <br>
        - And when we see it All
        - And the exit sign
        - Where cool creeks collide
        - Of the true and the tried
        - I will be home, hawk-eyed
        - <br>
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient
        - Searching, patient

  blurb: <span class="italic">Hoyas</span> by S. Carey is a hospitable statement about love, longing and the celebration of knowing it well. You will find the familiar S. Carey modern classical repetition pushed into the vernacular of electronic music and beat making. This is the warmest electronic music you'll ever meet. The beats swing, stutter and pulse while each instrument retains a heightened awareness of its form and function within the larger family of voices.

    - title: Two Angles
      lyrics:
        - I spy two lovers
        - Underneath a portico
        - They cling in November cold
        - They never were this bold and sterling
        - In the fog-lift
        - <br>
        - The swaying symmetry
        - Retreat to the falls
        - Cascading of everything
        - All to my toes
        - The beauty of two angles
        - And then my life untangled
        - <br>
        - I swear, I swear, I swear
        - <br>
        - In the cloud-hang
        - To a grass-blade
        - To the earth’s tomb
        - My love is real
    - title: Avalanche
      lyrics:
        - No one came to take you there
        - All the streams on Oberon
        - Everything you called to her
        - In your heart I know there’re words
        - These are not the ones in it
        - Everything you say you’ll do
        - I was in the corner room
        - We cannot to begin to lose
        - All it was and ever said
        - <br>
        - Don’t be there against my will
        - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
        - Don‘t be there for no one
        - <br>
        - Baby in the corner room
        - All that I could say to you is nearly ordinary
        - A map beneath window the sill
        - All that you could ever kill
        - All it was on Ever-seas
        - I need something new
        - I need solace
        - <br>
        - Don’t be there against my will
        - Don’t be there you’re takin’ stares
        - Don’t be there for no one
        - All the time

    - title: Marfa
      lyrics:
        - They won’t tell you
        - About the love and honor
        - They won’t find
        - I know stories
        - About reeling and falling
        - <br>
        - In that gentle grass
        - <br>
        - They say stories
        - About reeling and falling
        - I know the answers
        - Reeling and Falling
        - <br>
        - Use the forest
        - Midnight gentle grass
        - In that gentle grass
